# Onboarding

Hi all! Please note that this is a new repository from last semester as we (exec) are migrating the code to a newer tech stack. For now, when you clone the repo, all you should see is a login/logout button. Do not worry! Exec will finish migrating the rest of the code by the end of this week to pull.

1. Navigate to the folder where you want to download the code in your IDE.
2. Clone the Github Repository with git clone <this repository's url>.
3. In the terminal (root directory), run 'npm install'.
4. In the root directory, create a .env file.
5. Ask Hailey to send you a copy of the .env file contents.
6. Then open two separate terminals, and 'npm run dev' in the first, and 'npm start' in the second.
7. You should see in the terminal where you ran 'npm start' that you are connected to MongoDB.
8. Open http://localhost:5173
